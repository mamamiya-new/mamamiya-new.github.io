    <div>
      <p>Thank you for using our products, and your access to and use of the services is based on your acceptance and compliance with these terms. These terms apply to all visitors, users, customers and others who access or use the Services.</p>
      <p>Mamamiya Player is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>
      <p>The app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide my Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the app won’t work properly or at all.</p>
      <p>The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions.</p>
